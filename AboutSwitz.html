<h1>ABOUT SWITZERLAND</h1>
Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura;
the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's 8.7 million
are concentrated on the plateau, which hosts the largest cities and economic centres,
including ZÃ¼rich, Geneva and Basel.

Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle
Ages, following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy; the Federal
Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. Swiss independence
from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in
1648. Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality since the 16th century and
has not fought an international war since 1815. It joined the United Nations only in 2002
but pursues an active foreign policy that include frequent involvement in peace-building
processes worldwide.[16] Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the
world's oldest and best-known humanitarian organisations, and hosts the headquarters or
offices of most major international institutions, including the WTO, the WHO, the ILO,
FIFA, and the United Nations. It is a founding member of the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA), but not part of the European Union (EU), the European Economic
Area, or the Eurozone; however, it participates in the European single market and the
Schengen Area through bilateral treaties.
